        Holi is a significant and colorful festival in Hinduism, celebrated over two days in the Hindu month of Phalguna
        (usually in February or March in the Gregorian calendar). It marks the beginning of spring and is often referred
        to as the "Festival of Colors" or the "Festival of Love."

    <p>Victory of Good over Evil: Holi commemorates the triumph of good over evil, symbolized by the legend of
        Hiranyakashyap and his son Prahlad. Hiranyakashyap, a demon king, forbade his son from worshiping Lord Vishnu,
        but Prahlad continued to do so. The king's sister, Holika, who was immune to fire, was tasked with killing
        Prahlad by burning him in a pyre. However, divine intervention saved Prahlad, and Holika was consumed by the
        fire instead. This mythological event is celebrated as Holi.</p>
